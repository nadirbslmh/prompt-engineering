Data science has been hailed as the 'sexiest job of the 21st century', and this is not just a hyperbolic claim. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts the number of data scientist roles to grow 36% between 2021 and 2031, a clear testament to the growing significance of this field.

But what exactly is data science, and why is it so pivotal in today's digital era? This comprehensive article will walk you through the world of data science. From the data science lifecycle, its applications across different industries, the skills needed to break into data science, and more, we’ll provide a deep look into why and how data science has risen to prominence as one of the most dynamic industries today.

What is Data Science?
Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. In simpler terms, data science is about obtaining, processing, and analyzing data to gain insights for many purposes.

The data science lifecycle
The data science lifecycle refers to the various stages a data science project generally undergoes, from initial conception and data collection to communicating results and insights.

Despite every data science project being unique—depending on the problem, the industry it's applied in, and the data involved—most projects follow a similar lifecycle.

This lifecycle provides a structured approach for handling complex data, drawing accurate conclusions, and making data-driven decisions.

Here are the five main phases that structure the data science lifecycle:

Data collection and storage
This initial phase involves collecting data from various sources, such as databases, Excel files, text files, APIs, web scraping, or even real-time data streams. The type and volume of data collected largely depend on the problem you’re addressing.

Once collected, this data is stored in an appropriate format ready for further processing. Storing the data securely and efficiently is important to allow quick retrieval and processing.

Data preparation
Often considered the most time-consuming phase, data preparation involves cleaning and transforming raw data into a suitable format for analysis. This phase includes handling missing or inconsistent data, removing duplicates, normalization, and data type conversions. The objective is to create a clean, high-quality dataset that can yield accurate and reliable analytical results.

Exploration and visualization
During this phase, data scientists explore the prepared data to understand its patterns, characteristics, and potential anomalies. Techniques like statistical analysis and data visualization summarize the data's main characteristics, often with visual methods.

Visualization tools, such as charts and graphs, make the data more understandable, enabling stakeholders to comprehend the data trends and patterns better.

Experimentation and prediction
Data scientists use machine learning algorithms and statistical models to identify patterns, make predictions, or discover insights in this phase. The goal here is to derive something significant from the data that aligns with the project's objectives, whether predicting future outcomes, classifying data, or uncovering hidden patterns.

Data Storytelling and communication
The final phase involves interpreting and communicating the results derived from the data analysis. It's not enough to have insights; you must communicate them effectively, using clear, concise language and compelling visuals. The goal is to convey these findings to non-technical stakeholders in a way that influences decision-making or drives strategic initiatives.

Understanding and implementing this lifecycle allows for a more systematic and successful approach to data science projects. Let's now delve into why data science is so important.

Why is Data Science Important?
Data science has emerged as a revolutionary field that is crucial in generating insights from data and transforming businesses. It's not an overstatement to say that data science is the backbone of modern industries. But why has it gained so much significance?

Data volume. Firstly, the rise of digital technologies has led to an explosion of data. Every online transaction, social media interaction, and digital process generates data. However, this data is valuable only if we can extract meaningful insights from it. And that's precisely where data science comes in.
Value-creation. Secondly, data science is not just about analyzing data; it's about interpreting and using this data to make informed business decisions, predict future trends, understand customer behavior, and drive operational efficiency. This ability to drive decision-making based on data is what makes data science so essential to organizations.
Career options. Lastly, the field of data science offers lucrative career opportunities. With the increasing demand for professionals who can work with data, jobs in data science are among the highest paying in the industry. As per Glassdoor, the average salary for a data scientist in the United States is $137,984, making it a rewarding career choice.

What is Data Science Used For?
Data science is used for an array of applications, from predicting customer behavior to optimizing business processes. The scope of data science is vast and encompasses various types of analytics.

Descriptive analytics. Analyzes past data to understand current state and trend identification. For instance, a retail store might use it to analyze last quarter's sales or identify best-selling products.
Diagnostic analytics. Explores data to understand why certain events occurred, identifying patterns and anomalies. If a company's sales fall, it would identify whether poor product quality, increased competition, or other factors caused it.
Predictive analytics. Uses statistical models to forecast future outcomes based on past data, used widely in finance, healthcare, and marketing. A credit card company may employ it to predict customer default risks.
Prescriptive analytics. Suggests actions based on results from other types of analytics to mitigate future problems or leverage promising trends. For example, a navigation app advising the fastest route based on current traffic conditions.
The increasing sophistication from descriptive to diagnostic to predictive to prescriptive analytics can provide companies with valuable insights to guide decision-making and strategic planning. You can read more about the four types of analytics in a separate article.
